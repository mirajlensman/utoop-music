# uToop Music

uToop Music is a lightweight, GTK 3-based music player designed for Maemo Leste on the Nokia N900. It provides a terminal-styled interface for searching, streaming, and downloading YouTube audio.

## Features
- **Robust Search**: Uses `yt-dlp` directly for fast and reliable YouTube searches.
- **Local & Online Modes**: Easily switch between online streaming and local file playback.
- **Persistent State**: Toggling modes preserves your previous search results and filter status.
- **Keyboard Control**: Search-focused input and arrow-key seeking.
- **Download Management**: Built-in downloader with existing-file check (Download Again / Skip).
- **Configurable**: Defaults to `/home/user/MyDocs/uToopDownloads` on N900, falls back to `~/uToopDownloads` on other systems.
